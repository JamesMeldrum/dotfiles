      - Keep track of their PID's
        - Report them centrally
      - Implement common commands for them - start, stop, restart, std-out
        redirection
        - Have all coach members implement an interface
          - Should just be able to send SIGINT / SIGTERM, wait and then restart
      - Report them over http?!
        - Options to redirect std_out, std_err (std_out/std_err combined),
          redirect std_in over http
        - Security concern: Anyone outside of the VPC will be able to
          communicate with this process.
